## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[![Portfolio](https://github.com/vadim4web/vadim4web/blob/main/gh.png)](https://vadim4web.github.io)

I'm Vadim, a Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Developer with a passion for building clean, scalable web applications. Here's a bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** expanding my portfolio with new Vue.js, React, and Node.js projects.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** advanced problem-solving through platforms like LeetCode and Codewars, while experimenting with modern CSS techniques.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** Vue.js, API integration, or how I use Firebase and Vuetify in projects.
- ðŸ˜„ **Fun fact**: I bought my first PC in 2003 after saving up from a summer job in woodcrafting. It sparked my lifelong love for tech!
